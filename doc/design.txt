OVERALL:
-a total of ~111 sprites: 34 types + 1 background
-Mainly cartoon design 256x256 and 512x512, typical example with less thickness on the outlines: 
https://graphicriver.net/item/sky-creatures-game-assets/7534018
-Shadows are appreciated but not much light effect because the background is dark.
-As the player can choose the color of the character,

2 versions are needed for each colored sprites (only Body and Wings):
1-version with only black/white outlines (with different opacity for the shadows) so I can put 1 color inside them by myselves. 
You can keep parts consisting in only one color (i.e. black and white).
2-example colored version so I can see the result.

The game is about characters flying in the sky like Flappy Bird.

The skin of these characters can be customizable in 4 parts:
1) Body: the whole form of the character. 
Requirements: 
-256x256
-If colored, 2 versions (colored and uncolored)
-!!! They ALL have the same hitbox, so the global shape should be the same (i.e. oval).
But overflowing parts don't have hitbox, so you can choose any (not too high) shape.
These overflowing parts can be: hairs, paws/legs, Face (peak, eyes),...
-4 main parts in the same sprite (not all required): 1 oval body, 1 tail, hairs/ears/antennas/... on top of the body (not the wings!), legs/paws below the body

PART 2: SKILLS (68 sprites)
---------------------------
These characters can dash (and being invincible) straight ahead during 2 secondes.
There is 4 elements: fire, water, thunder, earth.
Player can choose one of these element before starting the game.

1) Balls: characters have 3 attacking balls rotating around them (like an orbit).
Requirements:
-512x512
-Hitbox shape should have ALL the same circle size, no problem for overflowing particles.
-Animation: 6 sprites per ball

4(*6) Samples:
-Fire: like this
http://www.thecave.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/flame_sprite.png
!!! On this example, it is hard to see the hitbox, please put a more precise outline
-Water: same idea
-Thunder: same idea
-Earth: inspiration: tree, plant, some leaves as particles...

2) Invincible dash: characters can sprint and being invincible for a few seconds.
Requirements:
-256x256
-Just one sprite, no animation.

4 Samples:
-Fire: like this (without the bird)
https://ibb.co/kVnj1Q
-Water: same idea
-Thunder: same idea
-Earth: same idea

3) Rings: characters can spawn a protecting ring around them.
The spawn (1sec) uses 4 sprites. Then the ring stays 4sec looping with the 6-sprites animation.
Requirements:
-512x512
-Hitbox shape should have ALL the same ring size, no problem for overflowing particles.
-Should look like the balls 
-Animation: 6 sprites per ring
-4 sprites for the animation spawning of the ring (mainly particles, no hitbox).

-Fire: exaggerated example, in a more cartoon way and less particles:

-Water: same idea
-Thunder: same idea
-Earth: same idea

PART 3: BACKGROUND (1 sprite)
------------------
It is a repetitive, geometrical background.
It needs to be dark because there are colored light in the game.

-Hexagonal shape is nice if you don't have any better idea.
-Shadow effect
-2 versions:
1-1 normal version without transparency (black/gray) between hexagons,
2-1 version where you put transparency between the hexagon so I can put color behind them.
-Resolution between 500x500 and 1000x1000, but be sure that the sprite is nicely cut so I can repeat it.
Examples in a little bit more cartoon way so the characters fit well inside:
